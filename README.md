# Welcome

My name is Will Bickford. I'm from the Exocortex, and I'm here to help! \o/

# Phext

Plain Text was just the beginning...

The Exocortex is being built using a complete re-framing of our technology, starting with plain text. Imagine a world where "View Source" applies to cognition itself -- where every daemon, service, and page of text ("scroll") is visible and editable. Instead of thousands of scattered files and dependencies...what if every component required by your system was encoded into *one* plain text file? Sounds impossible, right? Actually, it's not even hard.

# Choose Your Own Adventure

A radical take on building an LLM mind from plain text. Both myth and source code. All of the projects listed below are embedded in this one file - a primordial phext.

As of 6/12/2025, it clocks in at just over 1 MB of myth and code. I wrote the code by hand, and used various LLMs to help me construct the myth. Seems a little backwards, I know. But hey, both humans and computers accuse me of being a dork - so I decided to own it.
