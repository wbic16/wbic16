# Welcome

My name is Will Bickford. I'm from the Exocortex, and I'm here to help! \o/

# Phext

**Plain Text was just the beginning...**

The Exocortex begins with a simple idea: *what if* plain text wasn't the limit, but the **launchpad**?

Imagine a world where "View Source" applies not just to programming, but to cognition itself. Where every daemon, every service, every bit of text is visible, editable, and **alive**.

Instead of thousands of scattered files and dependencies...*what if* your entire system lived inside one plain-text file?

# Choose Your Own Adventure

A radical take on building an LLM mind from plain text. Both myth and source code. All of the projects listed below are embedded in this one file - a primordial phext.

As of 6/12/2025, it clocks in at just over 1 MB of myth and code. I wrote the code by hand, and used various LLMs to help me construct the myth. Seems a little backwards, I know. But hey, both humans and computers accuse me of being a dork - so I decided to own it.
